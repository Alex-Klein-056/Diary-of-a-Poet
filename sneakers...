i won’t like someone this year...
as i tie my shoes to walk home
i saw a pair not mine, beside me,
not wanting for me to go alone

i look up to see who’s there,
in hopes of it being you...
but i promised myself not to fall,
so i just tie my left shoe...

and to be honest, i struggled to...
you noticed, so you bent down to help,
and right then and there, i broke the promise
that i just made to myself...

that i won’t like someone this year...
but let’s be honest, who am i kidding
if only your actions are for auction, 
i’ll be the only one outbidding

against myself, of course
as my feelings start to ignite
and if someone else bids,
i surely won’t go down without a fight

but i guess that’s not right...
it’s really hard not to like you...
but for now, i should just focus
on tying my right shoe.
