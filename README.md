Hi!

I am Alex,
a BS Computer Science batch '25 freshman.

The purpose of this repository is not to share my programming progress.
Instead, the purpose of this repository is to serve as a journal entry for me in my journey of being a CS student,
juggling acads, social life, but this mostly focuses on my love life.

This is not a detailed journal, and might not be consistent daily,
but I will always put an entry whenever something of significance happened in my day.

This will also serve as a creative outlet for my poems.

Feel free to join me in my journey as a hopeless romantic poet, trying to be in the middle of 1's and 0's.
