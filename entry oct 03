I havent posted in here in a while ahahaha
Here is an update of the past two weeks
  We had several long exams T^T
  I bought a vintage camcorder
    using it mainly to compile my college life
    but also using it to record someone
  I failed my first practical coding exam T^T
    I got 580 / 1000 T^T
    and the passing was 600 T^T
    I will have to take the 'finals' equivalent practical exam of the course T^T
  So far, I have passed some of my major course long exams and a GenEd long exam
    I got 29.75 / 30.00 on my Math 21 Elementary Analysis 1 :)))
    I got 45 / 50 on my CS 30 Discrete Math :)))
    I got 87.0  / 100.0 on my Social Science 2 GenEd Course :)))
  I think I am surviving so far :)))
